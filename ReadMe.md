# PikaLTools

This repository is used to store our collection of tools related to the PikaL and other hyperspectral 
sensors we use at the Earth Sensing and Observation (ESO) Laboratory at EPFL.

While most tools are standalone, the PikaLSteviappModule include 
a set of tools for the Steviapp computer vision application 
(including the MALAHYD tool for manual labelling) and requires the Steviapp sdk to be installed.

Overall, this repository is still under heavy development and should be 
considered unstable and not used in production environments.
